                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                  As a landlord, you have a legal duty to ensure all gas appliances, fittings and flues in your rental properties are safe. This includes arranging an annual gas safety check by a Gas Safe registered engineer.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    <strong>Annual Inspections:</strong> Gas safety checks must be carried out every 12 months. We can set up reminders and schedule regular visits to ensure you never miss a deadline.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    <strong>CP12 Certificates:</strong> After each inspection, we provide a Gas Safety Certificate (CP12) which you must give to your tenants within 28 days of the check, or to new tenants before they move in.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    <strong>Record Keeping:</strong> You must keep copies of gas safety records for at least 2 years. We provide clear documentation and can help you maintain proper records.
                </p>
               <p>
                    <strong>High Energy Bills:</strong> An inefficient heating system costs more to run. We can assess your system and recommend improvements to reduce your energy consumption.
               </p>
               <p>
                    <strong>Multiple Properties:</strong> If you manage several rental properties, we can arrange efficient scheduling to service all your properties with minimal hassle.
